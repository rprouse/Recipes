This recipe guide covers three delicious sous vide dishes: perfectly cooked pork belly, edible cookie dough, and a beautifully seared steak.

## Pork Belly

### Ingredients
- Cloves of garlic
- Ginger
- Green onions
- Soy sauce
- Mirin
- Fish sauce
- White sugar
- Pork belly
- Butcher twine

### Steps
1. Rough chop the garlic, ginger, and green onions.
2. In a bowl, combine the chopped ingredients, soy sauce, mirin, fish sauce, and white sugar. Whisk until mixed.
3. Roll the pork belly tightly and tie it with butcher twine using a surgeon's knot.
4. Seal the pork belly in the marinade using a vacuum sealer or a large Ziploc bag.
5. Submerge the sealed pork belly in a sous vide water bath at 170°F for 6-8 hours or at 155°F for 24 hours for a firmer result.

## Edible Cookie Dough

### Ingredients
- Eggs

### Steps
1. Place the eggs in a sous vide water bath at 135°F for 2 hours.
2. Transfer the eggs to an ice bath to cool before using.
3. Use the pasteurized eggs for your favorite cookie dough recipe, such as Grandma Babish's brown butter chocolate chip cookies.

## Steak

### Ingredients
- Two-inch thick dry-aged porterhouse steak
- Clove of garlic
- Fresh herbs (rosemary, thyme)
- Oil (for searing)
- Salt and pepper
- Butter
- Bacon fat (optional)

### Steps
1. Vacuum-seal the steak with a clove of garlic and fresh herbs.
2. Set the sous vide to the desired temperature (125°F for rare, 130°F for medium-rare) and cook for 2 to 2.5 hours.
3. Once cooked, remove the steak from the sous vide and heat a cast iron skillet with oil until smoking hot.
4. Season the steak with salt and pepper (if not already done) and sear in the hot skillet for about 90 seconds on each side, forming a brown crust.
5. Add the reserved herbs and a generous pat of butter to the skillet, basting the steak with the hot fat.
6. Remove the steak and slice it into manageable pieces to serve.
