Enjoy homemade fresh baguettes for breakfast with this easy 5-minute work recipe.
## Ingredients
- 950 grams baker's flour
- 3/4 teaspoon dry yeast
- 730 milliliters room temperature filtered water
- salt

## Steps
1. In a large bowl, combine the baker's flour and salt, stirring to avoid contact with the yeast.
2. Add the dry yeast and the room temperature filtered water, then mix using the handle of a wooden spoon to combine the ingredients until a dough forms.
3. Ensure there are no unmixed flour pockets at the bottom of the bowl, then cover the bowl and let the dough rise for 8 to 10 hours at room temperature.
4. After the dough has risen, place generous flour on a pizza dish or clean kitchen bench to prevent sticking.
5. Use a dough scraper to gently remove the dough from the bowl without pressing it down to retain the air inside.
6. If making four baguettes, divide the dough into four sections; alternatively, divide into three or two pieces, based on your preference.
7. Carefully flip each piece to minimize flour on the surface and pull to form a baguette shape without pressing.
8. Place the formed baguettes on a baking grill lined with baking paper.
9. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees Celsius and bake the baguettes for approximately 25 minutes. Use the bottom rack for proper cooking.
10. Adjust the baking time as needed based on your oven's performance, then enjoy your freshly baked baguettes.
