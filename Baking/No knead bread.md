This homemade bread is simple to make with just four ingredients, resulting in a crispy exterior and a soft, porous interior.
### Ingredients
- 370ml (1.5 cups) warm water
- 10g (1 tbsp) dry yeast
- 500g (4 cups) bread flour
- 8g (1 tsp) salt
### Steps
1. Whisk the warm water and dry yeast in a bowl until the yeast dissolves.
2. Add the bread flour and salt to the yeast mixture and mix until no dry flour remains.
3. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest at room temperature until it doubles in size.
4. Scrape the dough out onto a well-floured surface, flouring your fingertips as needed.
5. Fold the dough 1-2 times and shape it with your hands.
6. Cover the shaped dough and let it rest for 15 minutes.
7. Heat a cast iron, enamel, ceramic, or Pyrex pot in the oven.
8. Transfer the dough to the hot pot neatly.
9. Use a sharp knife to cut a slit in the top of the bread, then spray water on the dough.
10. Cook with the lid closed at 220°C (428°F) for 30 minutes.
11. After 30 minutes, remove the lid and continue cooking until the bread has a nice crust.
