This recipe showcases an updated version of a simple bread dough that can be shaped into three different loaves, making it easier for all levels of bakers.

# Easy Ciabatta Loaf
## Ingredients
- 250 grams warm water
- 2 grams instant yeast
- 300 grams ripe poolish
- 12 grams salt
- 50 grams whole wheat flour
- 400 grams bread flour

## Steps
1. In a medium stainless steel bowl, combine warm water, yeast, and ripe poolish.
2. Add salt, whole wheat flour, and bread flour to the mixture. Stir until well combined.
3. Cover the bowl with a lid and let the dough ferment for 2 hours, checking back after 30 minutes to perform a strength-building fold (SBF).
4. Use a wet hand to pull the dough and fold it back into the bowl. Repeat this fold around the bowl about 7 times.
5. After the second 30-minute wait, perform another fold.
6. Allow the dough to ferment for another 60 minutes until it doubles in size.
7. To shape, flip the dough onto a floured surface, flatten it slightly, and cut it into two equal rectangles.
8. Move the loaves onto a parchment-lined sheet tray, cover with a sheet tray, and let proof for 60 minutes.
9. Preheat the oven to 480°F and bake the loaves for 20 minutes without steam.

# Crispier Rustic Loaf
## Ingredients
- Same as above

## Steps
1. Follow steps 1 to 5 from the Easy Ciabatta Loaf.
2. After the second fold, shape the dough into a rectangle, folding the sides over each other and pressing down to degas.
3. Move it to a sheet tray and time for another proof of 60 minutes.
4. Preheat your Dutch oven in the oven at 480°F.
5. Place the loaf into the Dutch oven and cover with a lid. Bake for 20-22 minutes, removing the lid after 12 minutes to let it brown.

# The Big Dog (Bouleb)
## Ingredients
- Same as above

## Steps
1. Begin with the mixed dough from the earlier steps, flip it onto a floured surface, and degas it.
2. Shape it like a professional Bouleb by folding the corners towards the center.
3. Place the shaped dough in a bowl lined with a tea towel that has been dusted with flour.
4. Allow it to proof for 60 minutes until it doubles.
5. Preheat the Dutch oven at 480°F and add semolina flour or cornmeal to prevent sticking.
6. Carefully place the loaf in the Dutch oven and score the top for expansion.
7. Bake covered for 18 minutes at 480°F, then remove the lid and lower the temperature to 465°F. Bake uncovered for an additional 20-25 minutes until browned.
