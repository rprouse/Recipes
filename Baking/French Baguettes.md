A delightful recipe for making authentic French baguettes with a crunchy exterior and soft inside, perfect for any meal or snack.

## French Baguettes

### Ingredients
- Strong bread flour
- Water
- Fresh yeast
- Salt

### Steps
1. Begin by adding water to a mixing bowl and incorporating strong bread flour.
2. Rub fresh yeast into a bit of flour using your hands, then mix it into the bowl with the flour and water.
3. Keep salt aside for later, and mix the dough on a slow speed for four minutes.
4. Incorporate the salt a few minutes before finishing the mixing process and increase the speed halfway through.
5. After mixing, allow the dough to rest; do not add flour unnecessarily, as this can make the dough heavy.
6. Use a scraper to gently manipulate the dough by folding it over itself, then cover it with a non-stick cloth and let it rest at room temperature for 1-2 hours.
7. Overnight, place the dough in the fridge to ferment and develop flavor.
8. The next day, remove the dough from the fridge; it should appear bubbly and moist.
9. To divide the dough, use a bit of flour on the surface and gently release the dough, ensuring not to touch it too much.
10. Cut the dough into pieces of about 150 grams each for shaping.
11. For each piece, use a cloth to help shape the baguette, folding it over itself to create a spine and sealing the edges.
12. After shaping, allow the baguettes to prove for about 20 minutes.
13. Preheat the Gozney Dome to around 300Â°C, and prepare to load the baguettes.
14. Lightly flour the surface and place the baguettes carefully using a wooden board or a baking peel.
15. Score the tops of the baguettes with a razor blade at a 45-degree angle for traditional cuts.
16. Load the baguettes into the oven and introduce steam by adding water to create a perfect crust.
17. Bake without checking for the first five minutes to ensure proper steam and rise.
18. Once baked, cool the baguettes slightly before enjoying or freezing for later use.
