## Neapolitan Pizza Dough

Ingredients
- 850 grams bread flour

4. Knead the dough by hand or with your preferred method until it passes the window pane test.
5. Place the kneaded dough in an oiled bowl, cover it, and let it rest at room temperature for two hours.
6. For better flavor, cold ferment the dough in the fridge for three to five days.
7. Divide the dough into six equal pieces by weight and shape into balls.
8. Proof the dough balls for one hour if made the same day or one and a half to two hours if cold.
9. Flour the work surface and the dough, then pat out the dough leaving a small rim for the crust.
10. Stretch dough by hand until about 12 inches wide.
11. Top with roughly pureed San Marzano tomatoes and pieces of fresh mozzarella.
