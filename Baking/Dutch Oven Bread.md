A simple and delicious Dutch oven bread recipe that results in a crispy crust and soft, light crumb.
## Ingredients
- Warm water
- Sugar
- Softened butter
- Instant or active dried yeast
- All-purpose flour
- Salt
- Neutral cooking oil (for greasing)
## Steps
1. In a bowl, combine warm water and sugar.
2. Add softened butter and yeast, then mix thoroughly with a whisk. Set aside for 10 minutes to activate the yeast.
3. Once the yeast is active, add flour and salt to the bowl.
4. Use a wooden spoon to mix the ingredients until roughly combined.
5. Turn the mixture out onto a work surface and knead the dough by hand for about 10 minutes, using a pressing and folding technique.
6. Shape the dough into a ball and place it in an oiled bowl, covering it with plastic wrap or a shower cap.
7. Let the dough proof in a warm spot for 1 hour.
8. Grease the Dutch oven with butter or vegetable fat.
9. After the first proof, gently knock the dough back and shape it again.
10. Place it in the center of the Dutch oven, cover, and let it proof for an additional 45 minutes.
11. Preheat the oven to 210°C (410°F) with 5 minutes remaining on the second proof.
12. Once the second proof is complete, score the dough with a baker's blade.
13. Place the lid on the Dutch oven and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
14. After 25 minutes, carefully remove the lid to allow the top to crisp up, then continue baking for the remaining time.
15. Once baked, carefully remove the loaf from the pot and let it cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes before slicing.
