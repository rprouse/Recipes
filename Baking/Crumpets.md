These homemade crumpets are easy to make and come out deliciously fluffy. Perfect for breakfast or a snack!
### Ingredients
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 300 ml warm water
- 7 g dry yeast (instant or active dried)
- 500 g plain flour (all-purpose)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- Olive oil (for greasing molds)
- Softened butter (for greasing molds)
### Steps
1. In a bowl, mix the sugar into the warm water until dissolved. Add the dry yeast and stir. Set aside until frothy.
2. In a separate bowl, combine the plain flour and baking powder. Sift the baking powder to eliminate lumps.
3. Pour the activated yeast mixture into the flour blend and whisk until smooth. Use a hand whisk or electric mixer.
4. Scrape down the sides of the bowl halfway through and continue mixing for the appropriate time.
5. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let it proof in a warm spot for 45 minutes.
6. Prepare your cooking molds by greasing them with a mixture of olive oil and softened butter.
7. Heat a non-stick frying pan to approximately 190°C (375°F).
8. Fill each mold halfway with the crumpet mix and place in the pan. Do not overcrowd; cook in batches if necessary.
9. Watch for the classic holes to appear as they cook, which should take about 5 minutes.
10. Once the tops look less gooey, carefully flip them to brown the tops until golden.
11. Remove the crumpets and place them on a wire rack. Repeat with the remaining mix.
12. Serve warm with butter, jam, or your favorite toppings. Enjoy!
