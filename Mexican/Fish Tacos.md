7. Mince two cloves of garlic into the vegetable mixture, then add salt and sugar. Toss to combine and let sit for 25 minutes.
8. For the spicy mayo, mix mayonnaise, sriracha, salt, lime juice, and optional paprika and agave in a bowl. Adjust seasoning to taste and set aside.
9. After 25 minutes, squeeze excess moisture from the slaw using a salad spinner, then add lime juice and agave/honey, along with chopped cilantro. Toss to combine.
10. Preheat the broiler and prepare a baking sheet lined with foil or parchment paper.
11. Broil the marinated fish for 6-7 minutes until cooked and slightly charred.
12. Remove the fish, let it rest briefly, then shred it into large chunks.
13. Warm tortillas and build the tacos by placing fish, spicy mayo, slaw, and pickled onions on top.
14. Serve immediately and enjoy your delicious fish tacos!
