This recipe showcases how to make authentic Taqueria-style street tacos with flavorful bistec, topped with fresh ingredients and served with salsas.

### Ingredients
- Bistec (beef steak, such as Chuck or sirloin)
- Olive oil (for sautéing and grilling)
- Diced onion
- Sautéed onions (sliced)
- Small yellow corn tortillas
- Fresh cilantro
- Lime (for squeezing)
- Red salsa
- Green salsa

### Steps
1. Prepare the diced onion and sautéed onions by slicing onions into fine pieces.
2. Trim excess fat from the bistec and cut it into thin strips.
3. Heat olive oil in a griddle over medium heat and sauté the diced onions until they are soft and translucent.
4. Once the onions are ready, transfer them to a plate and continue cooking the remaining onions until they have a light char.
5. Season the bistec with your choice of seasoning and place it on the hot griddle, using a heavy press to flatten it for even cooking.
6. Sear both sides of the bistec until it's nicely charred but not overcooked, then set aside in a foil pan.
7. Chop the cooked beef into small, fine pieces, similar to what you would find in a Taqueria.
8. Heat a little olive oil again on the griddle and lay down the yellow corn tortillas, softening them without toasting too much.
9. Assemble the tacos by placing a generous amount of the chopped bistec into the tortillas.
10. Serve the tacos with a side of sautéed onions, diced cilantro, lime wedges, and both red and green salsas for topping. 

Enjoy delicious street tacos just like they do in South Texas!
