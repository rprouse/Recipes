This episode features techniques for cooking three different cuts of steak: filet, NY strip, and flank, along with delicious sauces and dressings.

## Pan-Seared Filet with Red Wine Sauce
### Ingredients
- Beef tenderloin (filet mignon)
- Kosher salt
- Neutral high smoke point oil (vegetable or canola)
- Half a small minced shallot
- 1 clove crushed garlic
- 3/4 cup dry red wine
- 3/4 cup beef stock
- Sprig of rosemary
- Dried bay leaf
- Parsley stems
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- Unsalted butter
- Flaky salt
- Freshly ground pepper
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Fresh parsley (for garnish)

### Steps
1. Dry brine the beef tenderloin by coating it with kosher salt and refrigerating it uncovered for 1 to 24 hours.
2. Preheat a stainless steel pan over medium-high heat with neutral oil until it starts to smoke.
3. Pat the steaks dry and sear all sides for 1-2 minutes until they have a dark brown crust.
4. Transfer the steaks to a wire rack set in a baking sheet, insert a thermometer, and place in a 225°F oven until they are 10 degrees shy of your desired doneness.
5. In the same pan, sauté minced shallot for 1-2 minutes, add crushed garlic, and cook for an additional 30 seconds.
6. Deglaze the pan with red wine and beef stock, and add rosemary, bay leaf, and parsley stems. Simmer to reduce by more than half.
7. Add tomato paste and continue to reduce until thick and syrupy.
8. Remove from heat and whisk in unsalted butter until the sauce is thick and glossy. Strain out the solids and keep warm.
9. Let the steak rest tented in foil for 10 minutes, then slice against the grain.
10. Serve with garnishes of parsley, flaky salt, pepper, olive oil, and red wine sauce.

## Reverse Seared NY Strip with Compound Butter
### Ingredients
- Bone-in New York strip
- Kosher salt
- Unsalted butter (1 stick at room temperature)
- Half of a finely minced shallot
- 1 clove garlic (lightly crushed)
- 1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme (chopped)
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley (finely chopped)
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Optional chili flakes

### Steps
1. Insert a temperature probe into the thickest part of the NY strip, then place in the oven at 225°F until it reaches 115°F.
2. Combine room temperature butter, minced shallot, crushed garlic, thyme, parsley, kosher salt, black pepper, and chili flakes in a bowl to make compound butter.
3. Pat the steak dry and heat a cast iron pan with neutral oil until smoking.
4. Sear the steak for a minute on each side until browned, ensuring to sear the fat cap as well.
5. Remove the steak from the pan and let it rest in foil for 10 minutes.
6. Slice off the bone and cut the steak on a bias; serve with compound butter on top.

## Grilled Flank Steak with Dressing
### Ingredients
- Flank steak
- Kosher salt (2 tablespoons)
- White sugar (1 teaspoon)
- Extra virgin olive oil (1/3 cup)
- Juice of 1 orange
- Juice of 1 lime
- 1 to 4 cloves crushed garlic
- 1/2 teaspoon fresh oregano (chopped) or 1 teaspoon dried
- 1/4 cup parsley (chopped) or cilantro
- Thinly sliced scallion greens
- Red wine vinegar (splash)
- Whole cumin seeds (1 teaspoon)
- Optional red chili flakes
- Honey (2 teaspoons)

### Steps
1. Mix kosher salt and white sugar, then lightly coat all sides of the flank steak and refrigerate for 1 to 24 hours.
2. Preheat a grill on high for 10-15 minutes, then reduce to medium-high and grill the steak diagonally.
3. Rotate the steak to create grill marks and cook until the thickest part registers about 125°F.
4. Let the steak rest for 10 minutes, then prepare the dressing with olive oil, citrus juices, garlic, oregano, parsley, scallions, red wine vinegar, cumin, salt, pepper, honey, and optional chili flakes.
5. Whisk the dressing until emulsified, then slice the flank steak thinly across the grain.
6. Serve with the dressing and garnish with scallions, flaky salt, and pepper.
