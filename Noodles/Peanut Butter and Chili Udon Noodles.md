A simple and delicious recipe that combines rich peanut butter with smoky chili oil for a satisfying noodle dish.
### Ingredients
- 250 grams frozen udon noodles
- 3 tablespoons peanuts
- 1 tablespoon white sesame seeds
- 3 pieces of garlic, grated
- 2 sticks green onions, chopped
- 1 tablespoon chili oil
- 1 teaspoon sweet paprika
- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup
- 2 tablespoons smooth unsweetened peanut butter
- A couple tablespoons of water
### Steps
1. Bring a pot of water to a boil and cook the noodles according to package instructions, about 3 minutes.
2. In a non-stick pan over medium heat, toast the peanuts and sesame seeds for about a minute until they release their oils and develop a smoky flavor.
3. Transfer the toasted peanuts and sesame seeds to a pestle and mortar and crush coarsely, avoiding over-crushing to maintain a crunchy texture. Set aside.
4. Heat the pan again to medium-low and add the chili oil and grated garlic. Cook for about 45 seconds to infuse the flavor.
5. Stir in sweet paprika, toasted sesame oil, soy sauce, dark soy sauce, rice vinegar, maple syrup, and peanut butter. Mix well.
6. Add a couple of tablespoons of water to thin the sauce as needed and give it a good mix.
7. When the noodles are cooked, drain them and add them to the peanut sauce along with the chopped green onions. Turn the heat to medium and stir for a couple of minutes until the sauce is absorbed and the noodles are glossy.
8. Plate the noodles and generously sprinkle the crunchy topping of toasted peanuts and sesame seeds over the top. Serve and enjoy!
