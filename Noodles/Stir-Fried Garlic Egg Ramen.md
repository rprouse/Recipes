A quick and delicious stir-fried garlic egg ramen that transforms your instant noodle experience.

## Ingredients
- 2-3 Eggs
- 5 Cloves of Garlic (minced)
- 2 TBSP Olive Oil
- 2 TBSP Butter
- 3-5 Peperoncino (crushed)
- White parts of Spring Onion (divided)
- 550ml Water
- Ramen noodles
- 2-3 TBSP of boiled ramen water (optional)
- 2/3 TBSP Oyster Sauce (or 1 TBSP Soy Sauce)
- A little Salt
- A little Pepper
- Green parts of Spring Onion (for garnish)

## Steps
1. Mince half of the garlic and set aside the other half.
2. In a pan, add 2 TBSP of olive oil and 2 TBSP of butter without turning on the heat.
3. Add the minced garlic to the pan and turn on the heat to low, allowing it to create garlic butter.
4. Crush 3-5 peperoncino and add to the garlic butter to infuse spiciness.
5. Slice the white parts of the spring onion and add them to the pan.
6. Boil 550ml of water in another pot with a little olive oil.
7. Once the water is boiling, add the ramen noodles and cook for 3 minutes (the noodles should be less cooked).
8. Transfer the boiled ramen noodles to the pan, moving them to the side.
9. Add 2 TBSP of cooking oil into the pan.
10. In a bowl, whisk the eggs and pour the mixture into the pan.
11. When the eggs start to set, push the cooked parts to the center and mix with the ramen until the eggs are cooked about 60%.
12. Add 2/3 TBSP of oyster sauce (or 1 TBSP of soy sauce), a little salt, and pepper to the mixture.
13. Toss in the green parts of the spring onion just before serving.
14. Plate the stir-fried ramen and sprinkle additional spring onion on top for garnish. Enjoy your delicious and quick meal!
