This recipe for Fried Killer Spaghetti, or Spaghetti allâ€™Assassina, introduces a unique method of cooking pasta that challenges traditional Italian cooking rules. This dish, famously prepared in Bari, Italy, combines burnt pasta with chili and tomato sauce to create a distinctly flavorful experience.

## Ingredients
- Spaghetti
- Chili peppers
- Tomato sauce
## Steps
1. Prepare the spaghetti as per your preference, keeping in mind that it will be cooked in a unique way.
2. Begin by cooking the spaghetti and allowing it to caramelize and brown in the pan, which will introduce a bitter flavor.
3. Incorporate chili peppers during the cooking process to balance the bitterness from the burnt pasta.
4. Add the tomato sauce early in the cooking process to help meld the flavors together and soften the bitterness further.
5. Continue to stir and cook until the spaghetti is thoroughly coated and the desired flavors are achieved.
6. Serve hot and enjoy this unconventional yet classic Bari dish that has become a staple in local cuisine.
