## Ingredients
- Green onions
- Garlic (15 cloves)
- Bok choy
- Ground pork (200 grams)

- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine (optional)

## Steps
1. Slice the green onions, separating the white part from the green part.

11. In the same water, cook the noodles according to package instructions; usually takes about 2 minutes.
12. Add the cooked noodles to the wok and toss to combine with the sauce and pork.
