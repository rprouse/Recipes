This quick and flavorful recipe features gochujang and garlic noodles adorned with fresh vegetables that come together in just 15 minutes.
## Ingredients
- 250 g ground beef
- 10 cloves garlic
- 2 tablespoons Korean chili pepper flakes
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 0.5 tablespoon oyster sauce
- 1 tablespoon mirin
- 1 tablespoon Korean soybean paste
- 2 tablespoons Korean chili paste
- 2 tablespoons oil
- Green onions (whites and greens separated)
- 2 Baby Bok Choy
- Noodles (any type, preferably frozen)
## Steps
1. Slice the green onions, separating the whites from the greens.
2. Smash and chop 10 cloves of garlic.
3. Cut 2 Baby Bok Choy in half or quarters lengthwise.
4. In a small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of Korean chili pepper flakes, 1 tablespoon of sugar, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, 0.5 tablespoon of oyster sauce, 1 tablespoon of mirin, 1 tablespoon of Korean soybean paste, and 2 tablespoons of Korean chili paste to create the seasoning paste.
5. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a wok over medium-high heat. 
6. Add the ground beef and sauté for about 2 minutes until it’s no longer pink, breaking it up as it cooks.
7. Add the chopped garlic and the white parts of the green onions to the beef and stir for about 2 minutes until fragrant.
8. Lower the heat, add the seasoning paste, and stir continuously for about 2 more minutes while being careful not to burn it.
9. Boil enough water in a pot to cook the noodles, then add the noodles and cook them slightly less than the package instructions. Drain and rinse with cold water.
10. Blanch the chopped Baby Bok Choy in the same boiling water for about 1 minute, then set aside.
11. Add half a cup of the noodle cooking water to the wok, bring it to a boil over high heat, then add the noodles and stir for about 1 minute to coat them in the sauce.
12. Serve the noodles on a plate and garnish with the Baby Bok Choy, green onion greens, and toasted sesame seeds. Optionally, add a soft-boiled egg on top for additional flavor.
