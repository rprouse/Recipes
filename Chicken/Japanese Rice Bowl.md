This nutritious and flavorful Japanese rice bowl is packed with protein and fiber, making it a great low-calorie meal option. It features a savory blend of chicken, cabbage, and rice, topped with an egg.

# Ingredients
- 60g onion
- 150g chicken breast
- 50ml water
- 1g kombu (or 0.5g MSG)
- 4g ginger (1/2 tsp)
- 5g sugar (1 tsp)
- 10ml sake (2 tsp)
- 5ml mirin (1 tsp)
- 20ml soy sauce (4 tsp)
- 2 eggs
- 120g cabbage
- a small pinch of salt
- 160g rice

# Steps
1. Prepare the ingredients by slicing the onion and chicken breast.
2. In a pan, combine the chicken, onion, water, kombu (or MSG), ginger, sugar, sake, mirin, and soy sauce. Let it marinade for at least 5 minutes.
3. While marinating, chop the cabbage and set it aside.
4. On medium heat, cook the marinade for 2 to 2.5 minutes, taking care not to overcook the chicken as it can dry out.
5. Add the cabbage to the pan, ensuring it cooks evenly with the marinade.
6. In a separate pot, boil water for the rice. Once boiling, add the rice and cook according to package instructions.
7. After about 3-4 minutes of cooking the cabbage, reduce the heat to low for 2 minutes across the pan.
8. Boil the mixture on high heat to keep it hot when adding the eggs. After boiling for 5 seconds, crack the eggs directly into the pan immediately.
9. Allow the eggs to cook without stirring, ensuring they remain soft.
10. Serve the chicken, cabbage, and eggs over the cooked rice for a delicious and healthy meal.
