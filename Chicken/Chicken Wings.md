Learn how to make delicious chicken wings at home using various cooking methods and flavorful sauces.
# Chicken Wings

## Ingredients
- 2 pounds chicken wings
- Kosher salt
- Baking powder
- Vegetable oil
- Chicken wing sauces (Buffalo, Honey Mustard, BBQ, Gochujang, Alfredo)

## Steps
1. If using whole wings, break them down by separating the wing tips from the drumette and flat sections using a sharp knife.
2. Pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels to ensure crispy skin.
3. Lightly salt the wings and place them on a rack set over a rimmed baking sheet. Refrigerate uncovered for 2 to 24 hours.
4. For baking, preheat the oven to 250°F and place the wings on a lined baking sheet. Bake for 20 minutes.
5. Increase the oven temperature to 475°F and bake for another 20 to 30 minutes, flipping the wings halfway through, until crispy and golden brown.
6. For the grilled variation, preheat the grill. Place wings on the cooler side of the grill with indirect heat. Grill for 10-15 minutes until char marks appear.
7. Brush with barbecue sauce and grill for an additional 20 minutes, flipping occasionally, until cooked through and saucy.
8. Prepare the sauces: 
   - **Buffalo Sauce:** Combine 1 cup Frank’s RedHot, 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce, and 1/2 cup melted butter.
   - **Honey Mustard:** Mix 3 tbsp yellow mustard, 3 tbsp Dijon mustard, and 1/4 cup honey.
   - **BBQ Sauce:** Combine 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar, 1/4 cup water, 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar, 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 2 tsp yellow mustard, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp smoked paprika, and 1/2 tsp garlic powder.
   - **Gochujang Sauce:** Simmer 1/3 cup gochujang paste, 2 tbsp brown sugar, 1/4 cup water, 1 clove garlic (grated), 2 tbsp ginger (grated), 1.5 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp rice wine vinegar, and 1/2 tsp gochugaru until thick.
   - **Alfredo Sauce:** Blend 4 oz grated Parmesan and 2 tbsp butter. Stream in 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup water until emulsified.
9. Toss wings in your choice of sauce and serve hot. Enjoy your wings with your favorite dips and sides!
