# How to Make Chile Crunch
A flavorful and versatile condiment that enhances any dish, made from a blend of fresh and dried ingredients.

# Chile Crunch

## Ingredients
- 1 cup shallots, minced
- ½ cup garlic, minced
- ¼ cup ginger, minced
- ¼ cup fresh Thai chilies, minced
- ¼ cup dried arbol chilies, stems and seeds removed
- ½ cup dried shiitake mushrooms, finely chopped
- ½ cup salted peanuts, crushed
- 2 tbsp Szechuan peppercorns
- 2 tbsp everything bagel seasoning
- ½ tsp MSG
- 1 tbsp white miso
- 1 tbsp Japanese barbecue sauce (or soy sauce)
- 1 star anise
- 3 cups avocado oil (or peanut oil)

## Steps
1. Peel and finely mince the shallots, garlic, and ginger.
2. Mince the fresh Thai chilies and set aside.
3. Break down the dried arbol chilies using a knife and then a mortar and pestle until achieving a powdery texture.
4. Chop the dried shiitake mushrooms into small pieces.
5. Crush salted peanuts slightly to make smaller pieces.
6. In a Dutch oven, add the avocado oil and heat it over medium heat.
7. Once the oil is cold, add the minced shallots and Thai chilies, allowing them to fry until browned but not burnt.
8. Remove the shallots and chilies, allowing the oil to drain.
9. Add the minced garlic and ginger to the remaining hot oil, monitoring closely to avoid burning.
10. Once the garlic is lightly browned, remove it from the oil and drain again.
11. Bring the oil back up to 375°F and pour it over the dry ingredients: arbol chilies, crushed peanuts, shiitake mushrooms, Szechuan peppercorns, everything bagel seasoning, MSG, white miso, and Japanese barbecue sauce in a bowl.
12. Add the fried ingredients to the bowl and incorporate with the dry mixture.
13. Remove the star anise from the mixture after everything is combined.
14. Let the mixture cool down for 30-45 minutes, allowing flavors to meld.
15. Taste and adjust with kosher salt if necessary.
16. For best results, let it sit overnight before using; store in the fridge for up to a month.
