# Pastrami:  Cure & Smoke
In this recipe, you'll learn how to make pastrami from scratch, including curing a brisket and smoking it to perfection.
### Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon black peppercorns
- 1 tablespoon coriander seeds
- 1 tablespoon mustard seeds
- 1 tablespoon red chili flakes
- 1 tablespoon allspice berries
- 1 tablespoon whole cloves
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon ground mace
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 stick of cinnamon, broken into pieces
- 1 gallon water
- 1.5 cups kosher salt
- 1 cup white sugar
- 4 teaspoons pink pickling salt
- 10 cloves of crushed garlic
- 1/4 cup pickling spice mixture
- 8.5 pounds of ice
- 7.5 pounds of brisket flat
- 1/4 cup black pepper (for rub)
- 1/4 cup coriander (for rub)
- Mustard (for rub)

### Steps
1. Toast black peppercorns, coriander seeds, and mustard seeds in a dry skillet until fragrant, then remove from heat.
2. Crack the toasted spices with a napkin and a cast iron skillet to release their aromas.
3. Add red chili flakes, allspice berries, whole cloves, ground ginger, ground mace, torn bay leaves, and broken cinnamon stick to the cracked spices to create pickling spice.
4. Boil 1 gallon of water in a pot; add kosher salt, white sugar, pink pickling salt, crushed garlic, and 1/4 cup of the pickling spice mixture. Stir to dissolve.
5. Cool the brine mixture using approximately 8.5 pounds of ice.
6. Submerge the brisket flat (7.5 pounds) fully in the cooled brine and weight it down if needed. Refrigerate for 6 days.
7. After 6 days, remove the brisket from the brine and rinse under cold water to wash away excess salt.
8. Apply a thin layer of mustard on the brisket, then generously coat with a 50-50 mixture of black pepper and coriander (1/4 cup each).
9. Preheat the smoker to 250째F and place the brisket inside. Smoke for about 5 hours until the desired color is achieved.
10. Wrap the pastrami tightly in two sheets of foil to retain moisture and increase the temperature to 300째F. Continue cooking until the internal temperature reaches between 205째F and 210째F.
11. Once cooked, let the pastrami rest for at least 30 to 60 minutes before slicing.
12. Slice against the grain and serve, reserving the flavorful drippings for later use if desired.
